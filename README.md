# steam-library-cleaner

A simple script to help declutter a Steam library and remove eligible games.
Large parts of code are taken from [here](https://steamdb.info/freepackages/).
It's the same thing as clicking every "Remove" link on the page.

### Use at your own risk!
**This script is not compatable with the SteamDB extension! If it's installed, disable it or things will misbehave.** Paste [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LakeS86/steam-library-cleaner/main/script.js) in the developer console on your [licenses page](https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses/) to start.

And finally, **I will not accept responsibility for anything that goes wrong. Seriously, you're on your own here.**
